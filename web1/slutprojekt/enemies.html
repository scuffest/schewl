        <p class="page-content">ULTRAKILL offers a variety of enemies that differ vastly in appearance and behavior. They can be categorized into different types:</p>
        <ul class="unlisted">
          <li class="listareannoying"><span>Husks</span>: Tortured remains of humanity in a zombie-like form. Usually fodder.</li>
          <li class="listareannoying"><span>Demons</span>: Residents of Hell proper. Characterized by their humanoid stone exterior and fleshy interior.</li>
          <li class="listareannoying"><span>Machines</span>: Hell's invaders seeking blood for fuel. Highly varied, attack focused enemies.</li>
          <li class="listareannoying"><span>Angels</span>: Residents of Heaven that seek to maintain the natural order of things. They wield devastating holy power.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enemies are able to damage each other (as well as themselves) during combat, and will actively target each other in some select cases, such as a few scripted events involving Swordsmachine in [ 0-2: THE MEATGRINDER ] or in the multiple rooms of [7-3: NO SOUND, NO MEMORY].</p>
        <p>Enemies with an asterisk (*) next to their name indicate that they are introduced as a boss early on but appear as normal enemies later in the main story or in the Cyber Grind. Enemies exclusive as bosses are listed differently from standard enemies. Lastly, enemies that don't fall under any of the previously given categories will be given their own unique category.</p>
        <p>NOTICE: As ULTRAKILL is still in development, this list is subject to changes and additions. Some enemies don't yet have an official icon and use the ? image instead.</p>
